Linked list to represent a non negative integer

Description:

In this project, a linked list is used to represent a non-negative integer, where the most significant digit comes first
and each of their nodes contain a single digit. In this representation, an integer does not contain any leading zero, except the integer 0 itself.

The program begins by asking the user to input two non-negative numbers. The function sum returns the head pointer to the linked list representing the sum. Lastly, the main prints out the sum of the two numbers that were inputed by the user.
